Event Management Platform ‚Äì EventFlow

This project is a web-based platform designed to manage events. The application allows users to create, edit, register for, moderate, and manage events and services, with features tailored to different user roles: Administrator, Event Manager, Client, Moderator, and Supplier.

The goal is to provide a modular, secure, and scalable solution for managing events of various types (conferences, workshops, webinars, etc.), promoting collaboration among organizers, participants, and service providers.

Built with a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architecture and following Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) practices, the system ensures clarity in domain logic, role separation, and continuous security validation.

Technologies Used

Backend: Python + FastAPI

Frontend: HTML/CSS/JavaScript (with templates)

Database: SQLite

Security Tools: Bandit, Semgrep (via Docker), pip-audit, Snyk, OWASP ZAP

Others: Docker, Git, VS Code

Core Features

‚úÖ Secure user registration and login with role-based access control

‚úÖ Creation and editing of events by authorized Event Managers

‚úÖ Client registration to events with capacity validation

‚úÖ Feedback system with moderation workflows

‚úÖ Supplier registration of services (e.g., catering, venue rental)

‚úÖ Event category management by administrators

‚úÖ Audit logging of critical operations for traceability

üìÑ Documentation Overview

This project includes:

UML and DFD diagrams (Level 1 and Level 2) for each main use case

Aggregate and package structure based on DDD

STRIDE threat model and qualitative risk analysis

Security scripts and vulnerability documentation

üîê Security Strategy

Security was implemented with a structured plan aligned to SSDLC principles:

‚úÖ Types of Analysis

SAST(Static Application Security Testing) - Development - Bandit, Semgrep (via Docker) Goal: Identify flaws on the source code

SCA(Software Composition Analysis) - Development - pip-audit, Snyk Goal: Verify the used librarys

DAST(Dynamic Application Security Testing) - Post-deployment (local/staging) - OWASP ZAP Goal: Simulate a attack by an external hacker

IAST(Interactive Application Security Testing) - Optional (with automated tests) - Contrast, Seeker Goal: Combine static analysis with dinamic, usefull in apps with a lot of functional tests.

Example Vulnerability Documentation

Vulnerability: Use of hardcoded password in login.py (line 14) Phase Detected: Development Type of Analysis: SAST Tool: Semgrep (Docker) Severity: High Mitigation: Replace hardcoded password with secure credential storage (e.g., environment variables or a secrets vault).
